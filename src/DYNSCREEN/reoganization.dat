Reorganize screening calculations:

Calculate all frequency independent quantities:

Set frequency independent grids and calculate gtrl(E) on those grids. 
	Grid 1: E_min -> E_Min + i*Gam ->  mu + i*Gam -> mu
	Grid 2: mu - omega_max + i*delta -> mu + omega_max + i*delta 
                with odd number of points and point int(ne/2)+1 at mu.

Calculate v_ch, K(r,r')
Loop over frequency:
	Calculate frequency dependent quantities:
		Grid 3 = Grid 1 - omega
		
                Loop over grids 1/3:
			Calculate chi0_1
                Loop over grid 2:
			Calculate chi0_2
		
		Sum chi0 = chi01 + chi02
               
		Calculate W_ch
		Calculate beta
