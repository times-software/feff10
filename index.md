# FEFF10
FEFF is an automated program for ab initio multiple scattering calculations of X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS), X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure (XANES) and various other spectra for clusters of atoms. The code yields scattering amplitudes and phases used in many modern XAFS analysis codes, as well as various other properties. 

FEFF10 includes the addition of the finite-temperature extension and is linked to CORVUS. However the JFEFF GUI is not supported in this version.

This software was prepared with support in part from the U.S. DOE, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, DMSE grants DE-FG03-97ER45623 (Dept. of Physics, U.Washington) and DE-AC02-76SF00515 (Theory Institute for Materials and Energy Spectroscopies (TIMES)) at SLAC.
